<!-- HTML Style Rules -->
reference: https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/htmlcssguide.xml

1. HTML Validity
   Use valid HTML where possible. 
   Using valid HTML is a measurable baseline quality attribute that contributes to learning about 
   technical requirements and constraints, and that ensures proper HTML usage. 
    <!-- Not recommended -->
    <title>Test</title>
    <article>This is only a test.

    <!-- Recommended -->
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Test</title>
    <article>This is only a test.</article>  
   
2. Semantics
   Use HTML according to its purpose. 
   Use elements (sometimes incorrectly called “tags”) for what they have been created for. For example, use heading elements for headings,
   p elements for paragraphs, a elements for anchors, etc.
   Using HTML according to its purpose is important for accessibility, 
   reuse, and code efficiency reasons. 
   
   <!-- Not recommended -->
   <div onclick="goToRecommendations();">All recommendations</div>

   <!-- Recommended -->
   <a href="recommendations/">All recommendations</a>
   
3. Multimedia Fallback
   Provide alternative contents for multimedia. 
   
   For multimedia, such as images, videos, animated objects via canvas, 
   make sure to offer alternative access. For images that means use of meaningful 
   alternative text (alt) and for video and audio transcripts and captions, 
   if available. 

    <!-- Not recommended -->
    <img src="spreadsheet.png">

    <!-- Recommended -->
    <img src="spreadsheet.png" alt="Spreadsheet screenshot.">
    
4. type Attributes
   Omit type attributes for style sheets and scripts. 
   Do not use type attributes for style sheets (unless not using CSS) 
   and scripts (unless not using JavaScript). 
   
    <!-- Not recommended -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="//www.google.com/css/maia.css"
      type="text/css">

    <!-- Recommended -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="//www.google.com/css/maia.css">

    <!-- Not recommended -->
    <script src="//www.google.com/js/gweb/analytics/autotrack.js"
      type="text/javascript"></script>

    <!-- Recommended -->
    <script src="//www.google.com/js/gweb/analytics/autotrack.js"></script>
    
5.  General Formatting
    Use a new line for every block, list, or table element, and indent every such child element. 
    Independent of the styling of an element (as CSS allows elements to assume a different role per display property), put every block, list, or table element on a new line.
    Also, indent them if they are child elements of a block, list, or table element. 
    
    <blockquote>
      <p><em>Space</em>, the final frontier.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <ul>
      <li>Moe
      <li>Larry
      <li>Curly
    </ul>

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th scope="col">Income
          <th scope="col">Taxes
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>$ 5.00
          <td>$ 4.50
    </table>

6. HTML Quotation Marks
   When quoting attributes values, use double quotation marks. 
   Use double ("") rather than single quotation marks ('') around attribute values. 
    
    <!-- Not recommended -->
    <a class='maia-button maia-button-secondary'>Sign in</a>

    <!-- Recommended -->
    <a class="maia-button maia-button-secondary">Sign in</a>
    
7. Separation of Concerns

   Separate structure from presentation from behavior. 
   
   Strictly keep structure (markup), presentation (styling), and behavior (scripting) apart, and try to keep the interaction between the three to an absolute minimum.

   That is, make sure documents and templates contain only HTML and HTML that is solely serving structural purposes. Move everything presentational into style sheets, and everything behavioral into scripts.

   In addition, keep the contact area as small as possible by linking as few style sheets and scripts as possible from documents and templates.

   Separating structure from presentation from behavior is important for maintenance reasons. It is always more expensive to change HTML documents and templates than it is to update style sheets and scripts.

      <u>HTML is stupid!!1</u>

      my website without doing everything all over again!</center>

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="default.css">
    <h1>My first CSS-only redesign</h1>
    <p>I’ve read about this on a few sites but today I’m actually
      doing it: separating concerns and avoiding anything in the HTML of
      my website that is presentational.
    <p>It’s awesome!
